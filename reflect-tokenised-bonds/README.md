# Tokenised Bonds 
The 'Reflect-Tokenised-Bonds' or **RTB** program is designed to provide a permissionless primitive for protocols or communities wishing to issue composable *'liquid staked'* bonds. 

### ⚙️ Features of an Internet Bond

- Secured Deposits (only the depositor can manage their funds)
- A Liquid Receipt Token (representing your deposit & accrued yield)
- A Public Target Interest Rate (determined by the treasurer, and ensured by depositors experience of yield.)
- The Interest Pool (reward pool) which is a one-way distribution pool meaning treasurer cannot reduce accrued yield.

### Composable & Permissionless Primitive 🤝

The RTB program can be used by anyone who wishes to launch a vault. Simply call the two initialize instructions to get started {create_vault, init_vault_pools}

*the program takes zero fees to operate, for treasurers or depositors.*
